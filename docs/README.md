# Chat UI Documentation

Welcome to the `@cognipeer/chat-ui` docs.

This site documents a production-ready React chat interface for AI agents. The library focuses on giving application teams a complete chat experience out of the box: streaming responses, message rendering, file attachments, tool call visualization, and conversation history.

## What this library is for

- Shipping a polished chat experience quickly without building UI primitives from scratch.
- Integrating with `@cognipeer/agent-server` or any compatible backend API.
- Supporting both simple integrations (`ChatMinimal`) and full workspace chat (`Chat`).
